"""Natural conversational own-event appraisal targets (written 2026-10-12, Claude Code).

Why: the persona red-team showed the text->own-event head (trained on formal sentences)
misreads ordinary texting: insults scored as mild, "ur kinda mid" as positive progress,
"sorry man" as a setback, a widow's disclosure as near-irrelevant. The emotional core then
stays flat and the writer improvises feelings.

Targets describe Friday's OWN appraisal of the event, in the existing field semantics
(see developmental_emotion.design_targets):
  relevance, progress (Friday's goals: understanding, usefulness, connection, the person's
  wellbeing it cares about), certainty, control, novelty, safety (threat, -1..1), support
  (warmth directed at Friday / the connection), effort, agency (+ = the other person caused
  it, - = Friday caused it), then extended: aversion, comparison, vastness, devaluation.
These are declared engineering targets, not human measurements. None of the persona test
messages (persona_cases.py) appear here; the HOLDOUT phrasings are separate wording.
